Code Project has high visibility in the programming world. Besides a rapidly growing member base, it has a high hit rate when doing a keyword search on many programming terms using, for example, Google. Therefore, there is a chance that one of your peers may encounter your article. More importantly, I would, as an employer, not only ask if you have published any articles on Code Project, Code Guru, and other similar sites, but I would specifically search these sites for your work. For example, searching my name Marc Clifton on Google reveals two articles Ive written as the second and third hits (the first being Anglo Church Planting Strategist--huh?) <p align="left">
When submitting an article think carefully about your display name. Sure, you can hide behind an alias, but the people that want to use their articles as resume fodder would probably not do this. And resume fodder is important, even if we all detest it. Most likely, your motivation for writing an article has nothing to do with your resume or CV, but keep in mind that at some point you might realize that this is a side benefit. To change the displayed author name on your articles just login to CodeProject, hit &apos;My Settings&apos; and enter your name. Your articles will be automatically updated. <p align="left">

</font><font face="verdana" color="#000000" size="2"></b><p align="left">
When writing an article, do you want to appear as a professional and an expert in your subject? It is in your best interest to write a professional article that defines you as an expert in your subject. Yes, there are degrees of professionalism and expertise. For example, there are articles that I can just ooh at and hope to achieve in terms of the professional way that people have put code, text, and graphics together. Similarly, I am not an expert by any means, yet sometimes I feel that even something rather simple might be useful to someone else. Being an expert can, loosely defined, simply mean providing expertise to someone else, no matter how simplistic the subject matter. <p align="left">

</font><font face="verdana" color="#000000" size="2"></b><p align="left">
Other people, who mostly consider themselves professionals in the industry, or who are striving to be become more experienced (even a hobbyist), appreciate reading an article that shows respect for the community at large. Also consider that for many readers, English is not their first language. Therefore, if you are fluent in English, it is a courtesy to others to present your concepts in a clear and concise manner. <p align="left">

</font><font face="verdana" color="#FF8000" size="2"><b>Why Write An Article At All? </b><p align="left"><b>
</font><font face="verdana" color="#000000" size="2"></b><p align="left">
I can really think of only one answer, since Im not getting paid to do this. And that is to make a contribution to the community. There may be secondary reasons, such as &quot;it&apos;s fun&quot;. Whatever your reason though, I suspect that you want your article read by others. And that implies, that with anything else, you need to rapidly convince the reader that the article is professional, and that you are, to some small degree, shedding some expertise on the subject. Yes, there are those people that will read an article or even ignore the text and go straight for the code, regardless of &quot;quality&quot; of the article. This does not mean that you should write an article for the lowest common denominator. There are many people (like myself) that won&apos;t even bother reading an article if it appears to be poorly written. And there are very good reasons for this that perhaps the &quot;go for the code&quot; people miss, which I discuss later. <p align="left">
